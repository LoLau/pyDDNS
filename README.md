DDNS-chiasma
============

A Dynamic DNS system that updates DNS records. 

# Introduction
This python file has the following three modules: 

1. server

    `server` module used in the Sever. `server` provides RESTful APIs to get some silo information so that we can use these APIs to get client IP, get silo list or maintain each silo.

2. upstream

    `client/upstream` module used in the upstream machine. The upstream machine normally has an ever-changing IP. To keep track of the dynamic IP, we need to execute the upstream Python module from time to time. Once the upstream module is executed, it retrieves the IP of itself. If the IP address has changed, it will update the DNS record specified in the configuration file.

3. downstream

    `client/downstream` module used in the downstream machine. Since the local host file should be latest, we must execute the downstream Python module. `client/downstream` can get DNS record specified in its configuration file, and then modify the local host file to change DNS rules without any manual modification.

## How it works
### On the upstream machine
`client/upstream` has a configuration file named `client/config.yml` to store Server and DNS details. Besides, `client/config.yml` provides a entry named `getIpFrom`. If the upstream machine has an independent public IP, it will set to `Socket`, otherwise set to `ServerApi`.

When we execute `client/upstream` in the upstream machine, it will send `Get /silos/silo_id` request to retrieve the IP of itself. If the IP address has changed, it will continue to send `PUT /silos/silo_id` request to update DNS record specified in `client/config.yml`. So finally, we can get a latest configuration file on the upstream machine.

### On the downstream machine
In the upstream machine, we just get a latest configuration file but not the local host file which stores DNS rules, so we must execute `client/downstream` on the downstream machine. First, `client/downstream` sends `Get /silos/silo_id` request to get DNS record of silo specified in `client/config.yml`. And then, it will modify the local host file to change DNS rules to the latest version.

### On the server
`server` provides RESTful API to get client IP, get silo list or maintain each silo. And there is also a file named `client/config.yml` to store DB settings like `username`, so we can modify settings in the file for our actual situation. 

`server` uses web framework Flask to build RESTful API. For more details, please read the "RESTful API Specification" section.

## Installation
1. Make sure Python is properly installed on all platforms (i.e. Server, Upstream, Downstream)
2. Modify the `/server/config.yml` file to change DB setting, and `/client/config.yml` file to specify Server and DNS details
3. Execute following commands

        pip install -r requirements.txt
        flask --app=server.app initdb

## Start using the server
1. Execute following commands

        cd DDNS-chiasma
        set PYTHONPATH=%PYTHONPATH%;.
        python server/app.py
        
2. Open your browser, visit `http://localhost:81/ping`, and you would get the ping-pong JSON.
3. Alternatively, use `curl` to get it:

        curl -X GET http://localhost:81/ping

## Start using the client
### Downstream (End user)
On the downstream machine, execute following commands

        cd DDNS-chiasma
        set PYTHONPATH=%PYTHONPATH%;.
        python client/downstream.py

### Upstream (The endpoint with dynamic IP)
On the upstream machine, execute following commands:

        cd DDNS-chiasma
        set PYTHONPATH=%PYTHONPATH%;.
        python client/upstream.py

#### Notice
The command above is executed in Windows environment.But in Linux environment, the command, reference and separator for environment variable to set PYTHONPATH are different.

1. Windows
    * use `set` command
    * use `% %` to reference the environment variable
    * use `;` as the separator
    
            set PYTHONPATH=%PYTHONPATH%;.

2. Linux
    * use `export` command
    * use `$` to reference the environment variable
    * use `:` as the separator
    
            export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:.

Please use the correct command to set PYTHONPATH according to your system environment.

## How to run it automatically
If you want to run it automatically, please read this section and follow the instructions to set your computer settings.

### Task Scheduler in Windows
Task Scheduler enables you to automatically perform routine tasks on a chosen computer. Task Scheduler does this by monitoring whatever criteria you choose to initiate the tasks and then executing the tasks when the criteria is met.

1. Open Task Scheduler by clicking the **Start** button, clicking **Control Panel**, clicking **System and Security**, clicking **Administrative Tools**, and then double-clicking **Task Scheduler**. 
2. Click the **Action** menu, and then click **Create Basic Task**.
3. Type a name for the task and an optional description, and then click **Next**.
4. Do one of the following:
    * To select a schedule based on the calendar, click **Daily**, **Weekly**, **Monthly**, or **One time**, click **Next**; specify the schedule you want to use, and then click **Next**.
    * To select a schedule based on common recurring events, click **When the computer starts** or **When I log on**, and then click **Next**.
    * To select a schedule based on specific events, click **When a specific event is logged**, click **Next**; specify the event log and other information using the drop-down lists, and then click **Next**.
5. To schedule a program to start automatically, click **Start a program**, and then click **Next**.
6. Click **Browse** to find the program you want to start, and then click **Next**.
7. Click **Finish**.

### Cron job in Linux
Cron job are used to schedule commands to be executed periodically. You can setup commands or scripts, which will repeatedly run at a set time. Cron is one of the most useful tool in Linux. 

To edit your crontab file, type the following command at the Linux shell prompt:

    $ crontab -e
    
The syntax is:

    1 2 3 4 5 /path/to/command
    
Where,
* 1: Minute (0-59)
* 2: Hours (0-23)
* 3: Day (0-31)
* 4: Month (0-12 [12 == December])
* 5: Day of the week(0-7 [7 or 0 == sunday])
* /path/to/command - Script or command name to schedule

operator allows you to specifying multiple values in a field. There are three operators:
* The asterisk (*) : This operator specifies all possible values for a field
* The comma (,) : This operator specifies a list of values
* The dash (-) : This operator specifies a range of values
* The separator (/) : This operator specifies a step value

For example, if we want `client/downstream.py` to be executed every 2 hours, we should enter:

    0 */2 * * * /path/to/command/client/downstream.py

# Glossary
This section provides some explanation about few terms mentioned above. 

1. Sever

    As a Sever, it should have a static IP. Besides, it is necessary for Server to be installed the database like SQLite or MySQL. 
    
2. Upstream & Downstream

    Unlike Sever, the Upstream normally has an ever-changing IP. So the Upstream updates the DNS record specified in the configuration fileï¼Œand the Downstream get DNS record from it. It makes the DNS rules of local host file on Downstream is consonant with the Upstream IP address.

3. Silo

    The silo used to record the DNS information. Each silo has a unique ID, and each ID corresponds to a Sever. The silo may contiains more than one DNS record, and each DNS record contains hostname and IP address. We can get different silo information by different RESTful API on the Server.
